description: "El Monitor de Femicidios de UTOPIX was born in Venezuela as a digital space for monitoring, collecting and analyzing cases of femicides/feminicides reported in national, regional, local and international digital media using the OSINT method (Open Source Intelligence), gathering public information to correlate the data and process it.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation of this project is to generate information in the absence of official data from the Venezuelan State since 2016 on femicides/feminicides.\r\n\r\nAmong the objectives of the Monitor is the creation of a sub-registry with data on femicides/feminicides in the country, to raise public awareness of this problem, to try to influence the development of public policies and to support the families of victims of femicides in the country and feminist organizations.\r\n\r\nTo increase women's technological appropriation and empowerment capabilities in the defense of their rights against male violence and the silence of patriarchal society."
