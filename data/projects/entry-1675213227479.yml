name: dTeach – Decentralized Teaching Communities
description: "Decentralized teaching communities (dTeach) is an open and free educational content production platform aimed at teacher professional development.\r\n\r\nTo this date, we have produced 11 dTeach Guides and published them online. The Guides are interactive, modern, with excellent design and variety of formats, thought-provoking, and support teachers in their own professional development. Instead of prescriptive, old-fashioned, or traditional content, the Guides are complex, comprehensive and supported by multiple media formats in one single Guide. The Guides cover different topics of interest (described below), ranging from democracy, conflict mediation and computational thinking. \r\n\r\ndTeach contributors develop digital content through a complex and collaborative process of elaboration, editing, revision, and constant improvement. Our community of authors, editors, designers, and other contributors work with a clear objective:\r\nTo make relevant, critical, and in-depth educational content reach teachers in an accessible and open way.\r\n\r\nOur mission and long-term vision:\r\n•\tDecentralize the production, offer and access to open educational content.\r\n•\tFoster educational justice and the public education system by providing the highest quality and up-to-date teaching material \r\n•\tDemocratize funding opportunities in a way that independent researchers and teachers willing to innovate and disseminate good practices in education will find financial support to do so. Offer fair remuneration to the entire chain of actors in education, including support to the schools where participant teachers are located.\r\n•\tEstablish a chain of production of resources that ensures quality, relevance and accreditation to the resources created.\r\n•\tImprove the quality of teachers’ professional development by bringing in-depth discussions, elevating the debate on educational innovation, and avoiding naïve conceptions containing more-of-the-same regarding education.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics\r\n•\tThe Guides are open and free to use. They are published under the Open Education Resource License, following the UNESCO OER movement.\r\n•\tWe use a diversity of media and communication formats in a single Guide: all of them have videos, texts, references, external links, animations, conceptual maps, and more. We want to make sure that we make them as interactive as possible.\r\n•\tThe design is completely oriented to integrate the content. \r\n•\tThe visual and written language ensures that users can acknowledge their representation and that the content is carefully tailored to them."
