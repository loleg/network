name: Colouring Cities research Programme
description: "The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) is designed to support open knowledge sharing and collation relating to building stocks, to address current knowledge fragmentation. It does this by developing open code for open databases/platforms designed to collate, generate, visualise, and improve the quality and availability of spatial data on stock composition, performance and dynamic behaviour . \r\n\r\nThe CCRP is run by The Alan Turing Institute, the UKâ€™s national institute for data science and AI. It involves international academic institutions specialising in building stock research in co-developing and testing open platform code. We currently work in Australia, Bahrain, Britain, Colombia, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Lebanon and Sweden.\r\n \r\nThe plan is to create a global network of connected but independently run CCRP platforms able to engage stakeholders in knowledge and data sharing about stocks at national and local level. Our aim is to help create sustainable, open, spatial databases that allow for collaborative urban problem solving; to help minimise maintenance costs for these platforms;  to effect a step-change in the amount and type of building level attribute data available for those creating, managing, using, and researching into buildings; to rapidly advance scientific understanding of the stock as a complex dynamic system; and to help increase the quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience of stocks in line with United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n\r\nThe CCRP tests a model that involves stakeholders from academia, government, industry, the third sector, and local communities in feature design, and in content quality and management, in each participating country. It tests integration of four data capture methods and feedback loops between these : moderated bulk upload of reliable open datasets; crowdsourcing of expert knowledge at building level; data streaming, and computational generation of large-scale datasets based on inference and typology rules. \r\nTwelve types of spatial data on stocks are collected at building level. On Location, Land Use, Typology, Size, Construction, Age and History, Street Context, Team, Planning Controls, Energy Performance, Resilience, and how well the Community thinks buildings work. \r\n\r\nPlatforms are also designed to tackle common issues arising in relation to building attribute data fragmentation, completeness, quality, standardisation, geographic coverage, granularity, security and privacy.\r\n\r\nSpecial features being explored include colour-coding of application status for planning applications and streaming into building footprints https://colouringlondon.org/view/planning/ and capturing data in emergency scenarios."
